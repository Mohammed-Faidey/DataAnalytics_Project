# DataAnalytics_Project

![NFT_Projects Logo](/Unique_NFT)


#### This Project Is First one of it's type
#### Here I work On kaggle DataSet called NFT art collection 2021, using Explatory data analysis, NLP, Computer Vision and GANS.
#### DataSet URL [nft-art](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vepnar/nft-art-dataset).

In this project, I Made Full Stack Data Science Analysis and Every Task Is separated in its Jupyter notebook file
you can download the notebook and upload it to the kaggle dataset and work from there 
I suggest doing that as there are some commands based on Kaggle File Structure 
so You will not face any problems with files or other types of files structure problems
according to the limited time I have as this project is a project for the Data Analytics class of my MSc Degree, maybe there are no finished notebooks.
But as soon I have some free time I will make the code clean so you can more learn from it.

In case you want to work on kaggle directly
